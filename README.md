1) Stock Prediction :Stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." A stock is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of any company. Stock prices change everyday by market forces. By this we mean that share prices change because of supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall. Understanding supply and demand is easy. So, why do stock prices change? The best answer is that nobody really knows for sure. Some believe that it isn't possible to predict how stocks will change in price while others think that by drawing charts and looking at past price movements, you can determine when to buy and sell. The only thing we do know as a certainty is that stocks are volatile and can change in price extremely rapidly.

   Implementation:
     1.Using Sckiit Learning( Machine Learning model)

     2.Data Preprocessing using dataset

     3.Visualization of Dataset

     4.Feature Scaling

     5.Preparing the Datasets for training

     6.Reshaping the datasets

     7.Model development

     8.Implementation of sequential, dense, LSTM and dropout.

     9.Preprocessing the Data

     10.Predicting the Output

     11.Result visualization

2) Titanic Classification :A machine learning model on the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have been survived or not using the passenger data. 

So the data has information about passengers on the Titanic, such as name , sex, age, survival, economic status(class), etc.
